I try not to judge on the morality of what I show you.\n\nAs a person though, I have sympathy for this protest against the genocide in Gaza.  Not that I believe it will stop the never ending waxing and waning of suffering in Gaza or in the Middle East in general. It's a complicated conflict and most actors on the political stage in the Middle East have blood on their hands. The world is full of armed conflicts and they are hardly ever as clear cut as the Russian invasion of Ukraine where Russia clearly is the aggressor and where the victim is a democratic country we can help defend themselves and by extension Europe itself.\n\nThe genocide in Gaza is different from other conflicts, though. Even if The Netherlands and by extension the EU isn't capable of stopping this tragedy, we have a choice to befriend with the aggressor or not. For too long the West gave Israel the benefit of the doubt even when it clearly didn't deserve our help. We have a choice to not sing with them together in song festivals. We can make clear that whatever Israel is doing is disproportionate, that the revenge on Hamas has devolved into nothing more than an excuse to eradicate a complete population of innocent people who had no part nor say in this conflict. \n\nStation Oss, August 2025",
